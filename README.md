## PART ONE
## AI Tutor for Special Needs Learners (Kenya)
## Overview

AI-powered adaptive tutor to improve foundational literacy for Special Needs Learners (SNLs) in Kenyan primary schools. Supports personalized learning and aids educators.
## Problem

Addressing teacher shortages, limited materials, and need for individualized attention in Kenyan SNE.
## Solution

AI tutor that personalizes content, identifies difficulties, assists lesson planning, and boosts engagement.
## Tech

    Model: RNNs with LSTMs for adaptive learning.

    Data: Anonymized learner performance and SNE curriculum.

    Deployment: Lightweight, offline-first for varied connectivity.

## AI System for Patient Readmission Risk Prediction

This repository outlines the design and considerations for an AI system aimed at predicting patient readmission risk within 30 days of discharge in a hospital setting.
## **Part 2: Case Study Application - System Design**

This section covers the core components of the AI system.
## Problem Scope

Goal: Reduce 30-day patient readmission rates by identifying high-risk patients, improving outcomes and optimizing resources. Stakeholders include patients, clinicians, and hospital administration.
## Data Strategy

    Sources: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), demographics, historical readmission data, and potentially Social Determinants of Health (SDOH).

    Ethical Concerns: Patient privacy (HIPAA) and algorithmic bias.

    Preprocessing: Data cleaning, transformation (encoding, scaling), and feature engineering (e.g., comorbidity scores, length of stay).

## Model Development

    Model Choice: Gradient Boosting Machine (e.g., XGBoost) for high accuracy, handling mixed data, and scalability.

    Performance: Hypothetical precision (approx67) and recall (approx80) are used for evaluation.

## Deployment

    Integration: Via RESTful API, data ingestion pipelines, and embedding predictions in clinical workflows.

    Compliance: Ensuring HIPAA adherence through de-identification, access control, encryption, audits, and transparency.

## Part 3: Critical Thinking - Ethics, Bias, and Trade-offs

This section explores ethical implications and practical considerations.
## Ethics & Bias

    Impact of Biased Data: Can lead to inaccurate predictions and health inequities for underserved groups.

    Mitigation: Fairness-Aware Data Collection and Preprocessing by collecting representative data and using techniques like resampling or reweighing.

## Trade-offs

    Interpretability vs. Accuracy: Balancing high model accuracy with the need for clinicians to understand prediction reasoning for trust and justification.

    Limited Computational Resources: Necessitates simpler models, less complex feature engineering, smaller data subsets, and potentially batch inference, which may impact performance.

## Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram

This section reflects on challenges and visualizes the workflow.
## Reflection

    Most Challenging Part: Data Strategy, particularly ethical concerns and ensuring data quality/representativeness due to sensitive healthcare data and bias mitigation complexities.

    Improvements: Enhanced data governance, advanced bias detection, robust Explainable AI (XAI), rigorous validation, and continuous learning.
