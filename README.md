## PART ONE
## Real Estate Price Trend Prediction

### Overview  
This project predicts local property price trends using historical real estate data to help agents and investors make informed decisions.

### Objectives  
- Forecast future property prices  
- Identify key price-influencing factors  
- Provide pricing recommendations  

### Data  
- Sources: Zillow API, local government property records  
- Preprocessing: Handle missing data, normalize features, encode categories  
- Bias: Online listings may underrepresent off-market sales  

### Model  
- Random Forest Regressor for robustness and interpretability  
- Data split: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test  
- Tune: number of trees and max tree depth  

### Evaluation  
- Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²)  
- Monitor for concept drift by tracking prediction errors over time  

### Deployment  
- Challenge: Scalability for real-time data and fast predictions  
- Retrain model as needed when concept drift is detected  

## AI System for Patient Readmission Risk Prediction

This repository outlines the design and considerations for an AI system aimed at predicting patient readmission risk within 30 days of discharge in a hospital setting.
## **Part 2: Case Study Application - System Design**

This section covers the core components of the AI system.
## Problem Scope

Goal: Reduce 30-day patient readmission rates by identifying high-risk patients, improving outcomes and optimizing resources. Stakeholders include patients, clinicians, and hospital administration.
## Data Strategy

    Sources: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), demographics, historical readmission data, and potentially Social Determinants of Health (SDOH).

    Ethical Concerns: Patient privacy (HIPAA) and algorithmic bias.

    Preprocessing: Data cleaning, transformation (encoding, scaling), and feature engineering (e.g., comorbidity scores, length of stay).

## Model Development

    Model Choice: Gradient Boosting Machine (e.g., XGBoost) for high accuracy, handling mixed data, and scalability.

    Performance: Hypothetical precision (approx67) and recall (approx80) are used for evaluation.

## Deployment

    Integration: Via RESTful API, data ingestion pipelines, and embedding predictions in clinical workflows.

    Compliance: Ensuring HIPAA adherence through de-identification, access control, encryption, audits, and transparency.

## Part 3: Critical Thinking - Ethics, Bias, and Trade-offs

This section explores ethical implications and practical considerations.
## Ethics & Bias

    Impact of Biased Data: Can lead to inaccurate predictions and health inequities for underserved groups.

    Mitigation: Fairness-Aware Data Collection and Preprocessing by collecting representative data and using techniques like resampling or reweighing.

## Trade-offs

    Interpretability vs. Accuracy: Balancing high model accuracy with the need for clinicians to understand prediction reasoning for trust and justification.

    Limited Computational Resources: Necessitates simpler models, less complex feature engineering, smaller data subsets, and potentially batch inference, which may impact performance.

## Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram

This section reflects on challenges and visualizes the workflow.
## Reflection

    Most Challenging Part: Data Strategy, particularly ethical concerns and ensuring data quality/representativeness due to sensitive healthcare data and bias mitigation complexities.

    Improvements: Enhanced data governance, advanced bias detection, robust Explainable AI (XAI), rigorous validation, and continuous learning.
